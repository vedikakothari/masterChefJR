Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Butter three 9-inch cake rounds and dust with flour, tapping out the excess.
Mix together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a stand mixer on low speed until combined.
Add eggs, buttermilk, warm water, oil, and vanilla. Beat on a medium speed until smooth.
Divide batter among the three pans.
Bake for 30-35 minutes at 350 degrees, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
Cool on wire racks for 15 minutes and then turn out the cakes onto the racks and allow to cool completely.
Follow additional steps (in myRecipes) to make a chocolate buttercream frosting.
Enjoy!
